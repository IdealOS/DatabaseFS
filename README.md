# DatabaseFS
Ideas for a database as a file system for IdealOS.

- Entries are tagged by content-type and user defined tags.
- Tags are branch nodes in the tree.
- Documents are leaf nodes.
- A Browser window provides hierarchical navigation view of the tags tree.
- Clicking a leaf node opens the associated application.
- A leaf node can be a reference to an online service or data set.
